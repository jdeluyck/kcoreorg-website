For $reasons there was a [Citrix Workspace](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/) installation on my partner's computer. This installation hadn't been used in forever, and I did not manage to get rid of it either (uninstalling would fail, upgrading would fail).

Citrix publishes a [Citrix Cleanup](https://support.citrix.com/external/article/CTX137494/receiver-cleanup-utility.html) tool, which for some obscure reason they've decided to put behind a login-wall. Only if your company has an account with Citrix you can obtain it directly.

Luckely there's an easy way to obtain it: Download the latest Citrix Workspace app, and unpack the downloaded file using eg. [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). You'll find the Cleanup Tool within :)
