If you're living outside the US, and you're using [OpenWRT](http://www.openwrt.org) (a fantastic 3rdparty opensource firmware for many routers), you might have noticed that not all the WiFi channels which are [legally allowed in your region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels)Â are actually available for you to choose from.

This is a known issue, and stems from the fact that the OpenWRT images are built without CONFIG\_ATH\_USER_REGD=y (which allows overriding the wifi-card builtin default regulatory domain), so that the builds are compliant with the regulations of the US. (see [trac ticket 6923](https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6923))  
If you pick another region in the settings, the ROM will pick the most restrictive of the two - in my case this means that WiFi channels 12 and 13 are not available to choose from.

There are two ways to get around this:

  * Building OpenWRT from source, and enabling this option
  * Using [reghack](http://luci.subsignal.org/~jow/reghack/) to patch the drivers (see the [README](http://luci.subsignal.org/~jow/reghack/README.txt) on how to do this)

I only recently learned of reghack (thanks, [Stijn](http://stijn.tintel.eu/)!) which works nicely ;)
