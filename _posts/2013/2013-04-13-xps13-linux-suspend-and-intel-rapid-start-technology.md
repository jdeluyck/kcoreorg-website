As an addendum to my previous post on [how to install Debian Sid on the XPS13](/2013/04/07/dell-xps-13-and-debian-sid/), I've been having issues with suspend - the laptop would sporadicaly not go to sleep properly on lid close, or it wouldn't come out of suspend afterwards.

I seem to have found a solution for both:

  * The laptop suspends correctly after upgrading the [xserver-xorg-video-intel](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=xserver-xorg-video-intel) driver to the version available in [experimental](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental), andÂ upgrading the kernel to [kernel 3.9 rc 6](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/testing/linux-3.9-rc6.tar.xz) (which contains a bunch of fixes for Ivy Bridge, and the touchpad driver comes built-in). You'll need to manually build this kernel as detailed in the [Debian Kernel Handbook](http://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/).
  * The not waking up part seems to have been caused by the [Intel Rapid Start Technology](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/what-is-intel-rapid-start-technology) (iRST in short), which basically is an (S4) hibernate triggered from the BIOS a short while after you put the laptop in (S3) suspend (you never see this from the OS side). The laptop will dump the memory contents to a special partition on the harddisk and shutdown completely. Very good for battery life, less so for waking up from suspend - sometimes it would be instantaneously, sometimes it would take a minute or two, and at other times it just wouldn't do anything.  
    After disabling this in the BIOS the laptop works as expected.
