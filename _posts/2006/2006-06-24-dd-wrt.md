I reflashed my good old Linksys WRT54G router two weeks back, from using [Sveasoft](http://www.sveasoft.com/) Talisman to [DD-WRT](https://www.dd-wrt.com). I must say, I'm happily amazed with the quality of this firmware. _And, it's for free too_ :D (you have to pay a 20$/year subscription fee for sveasoft to have access to their firmwares)
