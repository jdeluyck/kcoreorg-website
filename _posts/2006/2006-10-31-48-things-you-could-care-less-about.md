I saw it from my [SO's site](http://sade.sadevil.org/blog/?p=83#more-83), so I'm gonna include it here!

  1. **First Name:** Jan
  2. **Were you named after anyone?** Not really. My father has a rather dull sense of names, and so well, I have a fairly common name in Belgium!
  3. **When did you last cry?** The last time I had to go back from Spain to Belgium... 
  4. **Do you like your handwriting?** It's usually a bit messy, but I can write cleanly and properly if it's not for me ;)
  5. **What is your favourite lunchmeat?** I have no idea. I don't eat 'lunch meats' to be honest.
  6. **If you were another person, would you be friends with you?** I have no idea. I think i'm pretty obnoxious at times, so .. you tell me?
  7. **Do you have a journal?** This 'semi blog' only.
  8. **Do you still have your tonsils?** Yep, all of them.
  9. **Would you bungee jump?** Yep, wanna try it one day. No idea what day, but someday :p
 10. **What is your favourite cereal?** MÃ¼sli, mÃ¼sli, mÃ¼sli and mÃ¼sli!
 11. **Do you untie your shoes when you take them off?** Nope.
 12. **Do you think you are strong?** Depends which kind of strong you mean. Physically? Yep. Mentally? Depends on the day. You probably wouldn't notice if I wasn't, though.
 13. **What is your favourite ice cream flavour?** Vanillaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 14. **Shoe size:** 41 (european).
 15. **Red or pink?** Red. Definitely NOT pink.
 16. **What is the least favourite thing about yourself?** I don't know. There are several things I don't like about myself, but well, the least favourite... no idea...
 17. **Who do you miss the most?** My girlfriend. Some friends from the past.
 18. **Do you want everyone to send this back to you?** Feel free to link and put a comment here.
 19. **What colour pants, shirt and shoes are you wearing?** Black pants (thin cotton), dark red tee, and brown sandals on the floor.
 20. **Last thing you ate?** Cheddar cheese, homemade bread and french fish soup.
 21. **What are you listening to right now?** A speech going on in Startrek Enterprise :p
 22. **If you were a crayon, what colour would you be?** a crayon that constantly changes colour to the colour you don't want it to be at that time!
 23. **Favourite smell:** The smell of a storm. Of very very heavy rainfall in a forest.
 24. **Who was the last person you talked with on the phone?** Someone from work.
 25. **The first thing you notice about people you are attracted to?** Hair, eyes and their 'special manners'. Everyone behaves in his or her own way, and you'd be amazed how much you can pick up if you pay attention.
 26. **Do you like the person you stole this from?** I didn't steal it, I asked politely! And yes, I like the person I got this from very much ;)
 27. **Favourite drink:** Water, coffee, tea. Capuccinno!

 29. **Eye colour:** Grey. Blue? Bluegrey?
 30. **Hat size:** If you really wanna know I can go check, I have a hat somewhere. It's even a fancy Borsalino hat! But now I'm genuinely too lazy.
 31. **Do you wear contacts?** Yep.
 32. **Favourite food:** Anything my girlfriend cooks! I love those! And mum's spaghetti, ofcourse ;)
 33. **Scary movies or happy endings?** I prefer happy endings.
 34. .. ?
 35. **Summer or winter?** Winter! I prefer the cold weather, with a fireplace and candles and snow and...
 36. **Hugs or kisses?** Both from good friends and family. I don't do that with strangers.
 37. **Favourite dessert:** Anything that's sweet, but not too sweet! And not too heavy either. Dunno... Vanilla pudding?
 38. **Who is more likely to respond?** ET! (what are we talking about here?)
 39. **Least likely to respond?** Captain Kirk! (does it show I don't get this question?)
 40. **What books are you reading?** The Engineering Guide to Red Hat 3, and the Narnia Books.
 41. **What's on your mouse pad?** What's that? Can you eat it? 
 42. **What did you watch last night on TV?** A part of a very crappy show called "Beauty and the nerd" which is a very very very big debasement of females and males alike.
 43. **Favourite sounds:** Silence. Birds. The laugh of my gf!
 44. **Rolling Stones or Beatles?** Beatles!
 45. **The furthest you've been from home?** That would be Greece. Or Scotland? Nah, Greece.
 46. **What's your special talent?** People seem to want to talk to me all the time. And I'm very patient (so they say...)
 47. **Where were you born?** Aalst.
 48. **Who sent this to you?** Noone. I appropriated it to myself after consulting with my lawyer.

So, have fun filling this and sending me a linky!
