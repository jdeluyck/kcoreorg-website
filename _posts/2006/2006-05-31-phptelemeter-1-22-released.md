I've just released phptelemeter 1.22.Â This release includes the following changes:

  * Added scarlet_web parser for Scarlet
  * Made skynet_web parser less prone to error on webpage changes
  * Cleaned up telenet_web parser a bit

As per usual, you can download it from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter).
