YAY! My new toy got delivered today!

![Palm TX](/assets/images/2006/06/tx_1.png "Palm TX")

Doesn't it look nice? It's a [Palm T\|X](http://euro.palm.com/be/en/products/tx/index.html), the latest model from the Palm factory.It's charging as I type, and looks very sleek and futuristic with it's black/blueish look :)

After my previous PDA ([Palm Tungsten T\|3](/2004/06/05/palm-tungsten-t3/)) which has served me faithfully for three years, it's a nice upgrade :)

I'll post my findings in days to come.
