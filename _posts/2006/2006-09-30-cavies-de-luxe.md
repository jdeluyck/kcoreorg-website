Seems they did like the [changes](/2006/09/16/the-cavy-cage/) I made to their cage... I had to modify a bit still, because appareantely they took to pooping on one corner of the cage, where the stairs used to be. Oh well, moved to the other side, and I added some cardboardish panels to the sides of their 'loft' so the hay doesn't spill out so much anymore :)  
I also made their floor 'complete' because for some reason Nero insists on smelling the bottom of the plate, and thus almost falling out (which he did once - no harm).

On weight news, the two blighters are getting big!

And on other news, with their last change, I tried some new bedding, called [NoSmell](http://sadevil.org/piwigo/picture.php/IMG_2569/category/73-our_little_critters), which is made from some weird biologic material (I think it's something that's left over from making linen or so), mixed with some sort of pellets. It's got a peculiar smell, not bad. So well, I tried it - it still doesn't smell as much as it usually does on change-day (being every 4 days), but still, it was necessary to clean it out. It does absorb better, but in the end you're stuck with such a kind of icky disgusting thick 'pasteish' like material... no thanks.

Seeing that that NoSmell crap costs about 5e for a two-times change, I think I'll stick with [my old style bedding](http://sadevil.org/piwigo/picture.php/IMG_2570/category/73-our_little_critters) ;) (costs around 8e for 28kg!)

But, they're two happy critters again :)
