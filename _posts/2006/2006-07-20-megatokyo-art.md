One of my favourite web comics, [MegaTokyo](http://www.megatokyo.com/), published a really very beautiful DPD (Dead Piro Day, a 'filler' image that's used when there's no real episode) of Miho, one of the characters of the Story.

Stunningly beautiful. Drawn by Fred, Coloured by Hawk (from Applegeeks (another web comic))

(artwork is &copy; 2006 Fred Gallagher - ofcourse!)
