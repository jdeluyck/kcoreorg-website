I've just released phptelemeter 1.26.Â This release includes the following changes:

  * Added new publisher, plaintext_graphonly, which only shows a graph. (Requested by Gh0sty)
  * Fixed telemeter_web parser (again).
  * Fixed dommel_web parser for overusage.

As per usual, you can download it from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter).
