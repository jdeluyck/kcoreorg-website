Hmmm.. what can I say, after being 'away' for this long :) I just didn't know what to post, or didn't think of it usually.

Nothing much happened meanwhile. I spent [Newyears in Madrid](/2006/01/08/newyear-in-madrid/), I went there again in February and will do so on March 16th...

I also got the latest album of [Neil Young](http://www.neilyoung.com/), titled [Prairie Wind](http://www.neilyoung.com/prairiewind.html) which is very good actually :)

Other than that, most things are going spiffy. I'm going to start into a new project for work soonish, only if I could find a way to be with Diana more it'd be purrfect.
