I've just released phptelemeter 1.10.Â This release includes the following changes:

  * New feature: phptelemeter can now check if there's a new version available. It only loads the url found in phptelemeter.inc.php, so no worries. If you don't like it, just disable it and it won't do anything.
  * New feature: proxy support, with new keys. Please check the README.
  * Slight spelling corrections
  * Implemented (untested) start of other platform compatibility
  * Corrected telemeter_web parser for changes in the Telemeter web page
  * Fixed wrongly used obsolete daily parameter when using -daily
  * Patched NuSOAP library to allow http proxy connections (didn't work earlier)

As per usual, you can download it from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter).
