I acquired a secondhand [HTC Desire HD](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_hd-3468.php), a nice phone (albeit a bit heavy). Comes with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and Sense. I'm personally not much of a Sense fan, and I wanted to move to a newer Android release, so I looked around on how to achieve S-OFF.

In the end, it's fairly easy, thanks to the [Advanced Ace Hack Kit](http://tau.shadowchild.nl/aahk) (AAHK now for short).

Requirements for the adventure:

  * HTC Desire HD, stock
  * [Advanced Ace Hack Kit](http://tau.shadowchild.nl/aahk)
  * A [recent radio](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=877295): I use 12.68.60.29U_26.16.04.09
  * [JellyTime for DHD](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1778202)

First, read the "effen manual" that comes with the AAHK. Find the code, and once you're in the menu, pick option 1 - "Hack Ace".  
Wait a bit.  
See the phone reboot some.  
Wait some more.  
\*poof\* you're now S-OFF!

The next thing I did was flash a new recovery (I'm a big fan of [4Ext Recovery](http://4ext.net/)), 
and after that downloaded the radio and the lastest version of JellyTime and the accompanying 
[Google Apps](http://goo.im/gapps/gapps-jb-20121011-signed.zip) and flashed those. 

A reboot later: _JellyBean on the HTC Desire HD_!
