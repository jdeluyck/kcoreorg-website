As a geek, I've always been quite the gadget freak. The fact that my father was also interested in the newest toys didn't help.

A quick list of my gadgets and phones over the years:

**_PDA history_**:

**[Psion Siena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Siena)  
![Psion Siena](/assets/images/2012/01/240px-Psion_Siena_512k_4f08.jpg "Psion Siena")**  
This I got as a gift, from my father. Used it a lot, but outgrew it rather quickly.

**[Psion Series 3c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3c)  
![Psion 3c](/assets/images/2012/01/Psion_3c_open_17o06-300x258.jpg "Psion 3c")**  
I've used this device though the majority of my school years, as a note-taker, game device, development device (I actually wrote code on that thing...). Used to also have several Flash SSD's for it.

**[Palm m500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_m500)  
![Palm m500](/assets/images/2012/01/palm-m500.jpg "Palm m500")**  
This PDA was the first one I bought after starting working. Used it to death. (not really, sold it)

**[Psion Series 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_5)  
![Psion Series 5](/assets/images/2012/01/series51.jpeg "Psion Series 5")**  
This I got from a coworker, who didn't use it anymore since it no longer charged. I replaced the batteries, and sold it on, feeling that Psion's OS no longer appealed to me.

**[Palm Tungsten T3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten_T3#Tungsten_T3)  
![Palm Tungsten T3](/assets/images/2012/01/palm-t3-249x300.jpg "Palm Tungsten T3")**  
As an upgrade for the m500, I got myself the T3. Quite a powerful machine for the time.

**[Palm T|X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_TX)  
![Palm T|X](/assets/images/2012/01/tx_1.png "Palm T|X")**  
This was the last Palm device I owned, which I sold some years back.

**_Mobile phone history:_**

**[Ericsson GA-318](http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_ga_318-99.php)  
![Ericsson GA-318](/assets/images/2012/01/erga318b.gif "Ericsson GA-318")**  
First phone. Came with three replaceable colour covers. Sold it to a friend in the end.

**[Ericsson SH-888](http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_sh_888-112.php)  
![Ericsson SH-888](/assets/images/2012/01/ersh888b.gif "Ericsson SH-888")**  
This one I stupidly forgot on a train (when I was in a rush...)

**[Philips Savvy DB](http://www.gsmarena.com/philips_savvy_db-151.php)  
![Philips Savvy DB](/assets/images/2012/01/phsavdbb.gif "Philips Savvy DB")**  
This one I got from my parents as a replacement for the SH-888 I lost. Stayed with me for quite some time.

**[Ericsson T28 World](http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_t28_world-118.php)  
![Ericsson T28 World](/assets/images/2012/01/ert28wb.gif "Ericsson T28 World")**  
My first flip-phone, which I bought after starting working. Stayed with me until the hinge system broke, causing the phone to shutdown when opening the flip.

**[Sony CMD-J70](http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_cmd_j70-280.php)  
![Sony CMD-J70](/assets/images/2012/01/soj70.gif "Sony CMD-J70")**  
Bought as a replacement, but returned rather quickly (the next day), completely crappy design and non-intuitive use. The knob (command wheel) on the left was also a total fail.

**[Nokia 3510i](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_3510i-344.php)  
![Nokia 3510i](/assets/images/2012/01/no3510i_00.jpg "Nokia 3510i")**  
My first foray into the Nokia world of phones. Nifty phone, worked quite nicely.

**[Nokia 6100](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6100-368.php)  
![Nokia 6100](/assets/images/2012/01/no6100_00.jpg "Nokia 6100")**  
Replaced the Nokia 3510i, since I wanted something with a bit more memory (for SMS').

**[Motorola RAZR V3](http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_v3-853.php)  
![Motorola RAZR V3](/assets/images/2012/01/motorolav3_black.jpg "Motorola RAZR V3")**  
The first Motorola phone I bought, which, in retrospect, wasn't a really well thought through purchase. The Motorola OS on these devices _sucks_. I still have it, the hinge sometimes fails (keyboard doesn't react), but sturdy as a rock (once dropped it three floors...).  
The only plus points for this phone are that it looks _damn_ good, and that it got me into the modding scene, as the Motorola OS was quite modifiable (flexing, anyone? :P)

**[Sagem MyX3-2](http://www.gsmarena.com/sagem_my_x3_2-631.php)  
![Sagem MyX3-2](/assets/images/2012/01/samyx32_00.jpg "Sagem MyX3-2")**  
This phone was purchased as part of a Vodaphone.es kit, since I had gotten to know my spanish girlfriend, and using a Spanish SIM in Belgium was cheaper for her to send me SMS'.  
(it is _possibly_ the worst phone I've ever used.)

**[Nokia E65](http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_e65-1860.php)  
![Nokia E65](/assets/images/2012/01/nokia-e65-00.jpg "Nokia E65")**  
_My first Smartphone_ (damn that sounds cheesy...). Still have it, use it as my work phone.

**[HTC Hero](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_hero-2861.php)  
![HTC Hero](/assets/images/2012/01/htc-hero-0.jpg "HTC Hero")**  
My first foray into the Android world, as my E65 was starting to show its age. Perhaps purchased a bit too early. Got me into Android modding and flashing.

**[HTC Desire](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire-3077.php)  
![HTC Desire](/assets/images/2012/01/HTC-Desire-1.jpg "HTC Desire")**  
This phone is my current phone, works wonders with the 3rd party ROMS you can find for it.

**_Tablet History:_**  
**[Asus Eee-Pad Transformer TF101](http://www.gsmarena.com/asus_eee_pad_transformer_tf101-3936.php)  
![Asus Eee-Pad Transformer TF101](/assets/images/2012/01/asus-transformer-1.jpg "Asus Eee-Pad Transformer TF101")**  
The only tablet I've gotten sofar ;)
