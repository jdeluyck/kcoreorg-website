I've just released phptelemeter 1.36-beta3. This version includes the following changes:

  * Added the NEWS file to the files to check if there's a configuration issue
  * Added a default for argv=empty array if not set, to avoid another warning (Thanks to jorgo from userbase.be)
  * Updated telemeter_web (updated website)
  * Fixed telemeter4tools for FUP meters
  * Fixed telemeter_web for FUP meters

As per usual, you can download it from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter).
