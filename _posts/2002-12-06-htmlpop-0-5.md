This script allows you to download POP3 mailboxes over an HTTP interface. I wrote it to allow me to get my mail through the company&#8217;s http proxy server.

## Installation

To install it, put the htmlpop.php script somewhere on a PHP4 enabled webserver.  
Also, make sure the directory where you are installing this script has it&#8217;s permissions set so the user of the http process can write to it (usually making it world writable helps. Just don&#8217;t put anything of value in that directory!)

## Usage

From any webbrowser (or file getting tool like wget), call the url as follows:

`http://web.server/directory/htmlpop.php?popHost=pop.server.com&popUser=myuser&popPass=mypass`

The script takes the following parameters:

  * popHost=<your POP3 server>
  * popUser=<your POP3 username>
  * popPass=<your POP3 password>

This will probably take a while (depending on the size of the mail in your mailbox), but after a while your browser should ask you where to store the file.

The file itself is an mbox-compatible file containing the contents of your mailbox.
