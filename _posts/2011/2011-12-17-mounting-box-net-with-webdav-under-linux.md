I recently got a [Box](http://www.box.com) account with 50 gB of online storage (see [this thread on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1383808) on how to get one).

To get it mounted under linux, install the `davfs2` package, add your credentials in `/etc/davfs2/secrets` with the syntax:

```
https://www.box.net/dav <email address used in account> <password>
```

Next, edit the `/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf` file, to disable locking. It doesn't really support it, and causes input/output errors when trying to write anything to the filesystem. To this file you should add the entry 

```
use_locks   0
```

To automatically mount it at boot, you can add the following to `/etc/fstab` (all in one line):

```
https://www.box.net/dav /mnt/box.net davfs   defaults,uid=<your linux user>,gid=<your linux group> 0 0
```

Now you just need to create the directory, and mount it:

```
mkdir /mnt/box.net
mount /mnt/box.net
```

Et voila, you can now use your Box account as a regular filesystem ;)
