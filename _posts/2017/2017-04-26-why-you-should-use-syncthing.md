I've been a user of [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) for ages, I've tried [Owncloud](https://owncloud.org/), I've tried [Box](https://www.box.com/), and probably numerous others that I've forgotten about, but in the past year I've migrated over to [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), and I haven't looked back. Opensource software, well designed protocol, complete ownership of your data, I could go on... but this post by [gbolo](https://linuxctl.com/) explains it perfectly!
