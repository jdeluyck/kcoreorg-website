Because I keep forgetting them, here's a list of buttons you can press during a Mac's boot to change behaviour:

| Key | Action | 
| --- | --- |
| C | boot from CD or DVD |
| N | attempt to start up from a network server (NetBoot) |
| T | start up in FireWire target disk mode |
| X | force Mac OS X startup |
| Shift | boot into safe mode |
| Mouse button | eject CD before booting normally |
| Command-S |boot into single user mode |
| Command-V | verbose boot |
| Option | choose startup disk at boot time |
| Option-Command-Shift-Delete | Bypass primary startup volume and seek a different startup volume (such as a CD or external disk) |
