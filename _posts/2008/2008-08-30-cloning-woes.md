After yesterday's [clone](/2008/08/29/bigger-disk/) I noticed some applications behaved erraticly, amongst which Preview, Thunderbird, Appfresh... rather irritating.

After some searching I found the fix on this [CCC Forum thread](http://forums.bombich.com/viewtopic.php?p=42055#42055):

```bash
sudo chgrp wheel /var/folders/*  
sudo chmod 700 $TMPDIR  
sudo chown $USER $TMPDIR
``` 

In short, the permissions for that directory weren't taken over correctly from the original, hence the problems. All fixed now ;)
