Yesterday I had some good old fun trying to replace the backup battery of an [Acer](http://www.acer.com) [Travelmate 803]() laptop. 

I thought that since this is a part that should be replaceable by the user, it should be reachable (like the memory, harddisk, you know). Guess again !

After flipping through the service manual (which I had luckily found), it seemed that there were no disassembly instructions for this battery. Looking on the blueprints of the motherboard, it showed the battery as being on the _underside_ of the motherboard - ergo, requiring full disassembly of the laptop... wtf?!?

I'm damn glad that I had the manual, because otherwise I think getting this thing apart is not quite so easy.

Here are some after-disassembly-pics:

And here, the battery...

which ofcourse had to be of another type than the five we have in the house, so now I have to wait with the reassembly until tomorrow after I get the friggin' battery! <deity>-damnit! Couldn't they stick to the standard CR2032!?
