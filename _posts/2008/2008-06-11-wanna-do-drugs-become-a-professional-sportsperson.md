I can get so goddamn annoyed at our local sport-crazy people...

The latest idiocy: [Tom Boonen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Boonen), a professional cyclist, has been caught (outside of a sports event) using [cocaine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine). Using this drug is an offence, punishable by law.

What does our wonderful country do? "Oh, my, poor guy, he probably took it because he was so lonely... bad drugs! bad drugs! good Tom! Let's make a martyr and a hero out of him, but most of all, let's definitly not punish him!"

WTF?!? He's just an idiot, who 1. doesn't do SHIT for our country (he's been living in Monaco since 2005, so we don't really see any tax revenue from him), does harddrugs, and now says "I'm sorry" and everything is okay again?!?

His team is not gonna punish him. The government is not going to punish him. Luckely some other countries (thank you Switserland) have a bit more sense and banned him participating.

I really do hate this aspect of my country. Really really do.
