_(sung to the tune of John Lennon’s “Imagine”)_

Imagine there’s no Apple,  
No products that begin with “i,”  
No monthly iPod models,  
No Apple stores to get you high.  
Imagine all the people  
Finding other things to do!

Imagine there’s no bloggers...  
It isn’t hard to do!  
No viruses or spyware,  
No weekly Windows patches, too  
Imagine all the people  
Learning to get a life... 

(You-hoo-hoo!)

You may say it’d be a nightmare  
Without Google, Mac or Dell  
We might have real conversations-  
But the world would be dull as hell! 

Imagine no new cellphones;  
Kiss console games goodbye.  
No David Pogue or Mossberg  
To tell us what to buy.  
Imagine all the people  
Getting some exercise! 

(You-hoo-hoo!)

You may say that I’m a loony  
But rest assured I’m almost done.  
I’m pretty sure it’ll never happen  
So we nerds can live as one!
