This is not a good weekend. For me atleast&#8230;

  * Yesterday, an upgrade at work took longer than expected. Hence, had to call of external testing parties. Today I had to call them again, but most were not available. Joy for tomorrow.
  * Yesterday, windows decided to eat a partition which was on a Dynamic Disk. Scanned it today with GetDataBack, but only got half of my stuff back. No joy.
  * For some reason, parts of my linux installation broke themselves. No joy.
  * This morning, yet another thing broke at work, for obscure reasons. Even less joy.

Can this weekend be over and done already?
