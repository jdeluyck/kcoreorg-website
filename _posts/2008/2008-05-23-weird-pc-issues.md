I've been having a weird issue with the motherboard on my pc. The first time you boot it in a day, it was very likely to freeze on you - either after the USB started flopping on and off, or the sound starting cracking, and so on... not very fun. Solution: power off the power supply for a minute, power it back on, and it would be good to go for the rest of the day. It's not an unknown issue (see [this thread](http://forum.abit-usa.com/showthread.php?p=739569) on the Abit forums)

The weird thing is, this problem only started after [switching cases](/2007/09/06/its-oh-so-quiet/) due to noise. No idea why, the power supply is actually more stable than the previous one! 

I recently related this to some coworkers, and one of them still had a spare motherboard around... so I recently replaced my [Abit](http://www.abit.com.tw/) [KN9-SLI](http://www.abit.com.tw/page/en/motherboard/motherboard_detail.php?pMODEL_NAME=KN9+SLI&fMTYPE=Socket%20AM2) mainboard with an [Asus](http://www.asus.com/) [M2N-SLI Deluxe](http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&l2=101&l3=301&model=1160&modelmenu=1) mainboard, and have had no problems since. I finally have a stable pc again! :)
