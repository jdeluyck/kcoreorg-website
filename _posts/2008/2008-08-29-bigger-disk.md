Upgraded my Macbook with a bigger disk: from an 80gb [Toshiba](http://www.storage.toshiba.eu) [MK8034GSX](http://www.storage.toshiba.eu/index.php?id=3&pid=192) drive (with which it came delivered) to a (secondhand) 320gb [Hitachi](https://www.hgst.com/) [HTS543232L9A300](https://www.hgst.com/sites/default/files/resources/Travelstar_5K320_DS.pdf) (what's in a name...). Long live diskspace! ;)

And thanks to [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html) the migration was painless.
