Once again, Belgium is the laughing stock of the EU.

Once again, we're without a government, due to their [own inability to follow the constitutional division between the powers in the country](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/12/19/belgium.government.resignation/index.html#cnnSTCText) (justice/political).

Great.

Politicians: pay back the wages you've been (over)payed, and go home. It really is time to put some people at the wheel that know what they're doing, because obviously the ones we had up to now are le crap.
