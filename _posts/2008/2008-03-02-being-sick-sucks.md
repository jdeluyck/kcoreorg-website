Since last weekend I've been stuck with a nasty cold, reaching climax on wednesday when I bailed work at noon and went to the doctor. Sickleave until friday, and some painkiller (perdolan) and a coughsirup (mjummm.. not!)

Friday I was finally rid of it, and today (being sunday) I woke up with a totally inflamated throat making anything related to the throat nearly impossible due to the high level of pain... damnit!

Another doctor's visit later I'm on Cataflam and Neogolaspetine spray, and two more days sickleave... meh.
