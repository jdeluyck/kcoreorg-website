Nicked from [Diana's blog](http://sade.sadevil.org/blog/2008/11/28/me-me-the-christmas-edition), here's my list of 27 things that you couldn't care less about. Oh, and about xmess too. Or christmas. Whatever you want to call it.

  1. **Wrapping paper or gift bags?**  
    Wrapping paper. Nicer, but not so ecological.
  2. **Real tree or Artificial?**  
    Artificial tree. I hate it to buy a tree that you're gonna throw away anyway afterwards. If I could have a tree that we would dig up, put inside, afterwards put back outside in the earth to let it live, I'd be all for that.
  3. **When do you put up the tree?**  
    First-second week(end) of december.
  4. **When do you take the tree down?**  
    Somewhere in the beginning of the new year. Or later. :p
  5. **Do you like eggnog?**  
    No idea, it's not done here.
  6. **Favorite gift received as a child?**  
    I don't remember at all. Probably my first computer :p
  7. **Hardest person to buy for?**  
    My father. Zero imagination, zero hobbies.
  8. **Easiest person to buy for?**  
    Diana. And also at the same time a hard person to buy for ;)
  9. **Do you have a nativity scene?**  
    Originally, yes. But very originally, when I was like 5 years old. I don't believe in the stuff anymore, it's been a tradition in the family for years. And a nice one ;)
 10. **Mail or email Christmas cards?**  
    Snail mail self-made Christmas cards. People that I don't have addresses for I usually email a card.
 11. **Worst Christmas gift you ever received?**  
    Uhhm... I think it was a set of towels. Not really sure anymore.
 12. **Favorite Christmas Movie?**  
    [Scrooged](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096061/) ;) tough the [1st Harry Potter movie](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/) is very christmassy too.
 13. **When do you start shopping for Christmas?**  
    I start thinking of it round october/november, and shopping (online :p) in november.
 14. **Have you ever recycled a Christmas present?**  
    Depends on your definition of recycling. I've re-gifted stuff to other people, yes ;)
 15. **Favorite thing to eat at Christmas?**  
    Uuh... nothing really...
 16. **Lights on the tree?**  
    Yup, colourful blinky lights. We originally set out to look for LED-based lights, but those were too damn expensive... We only light them when we're in the room though.
 17. **Favorite Christmas song?**  
    Don’t really have a favourite.
 18. **Travel at Christmas or stay home?**  
    Depends. With my girlfriend I'd prolly vote for either, as long as we get to spend the time together ;)
 19. **Can you name all of Santa’s reindeer’s?**  
    Dancer, Dasher, Vixen, Prancer, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen. And ofcourse Rudolph. 
 20. **Angel on the tree top or a star?**  
    Neither. More like a poky-thingy. Dunno what it's called. 
 21. **Open the presents Christmas Eve or morning?**  
    Christmas eve and New years eve. Christmas morning is for playing with them :p
 22. **Most annoying thing about this time of the year?**  
    Too many people in every place, suddenly forgotten how to behave, how to drive, and so on. 
 23. **Favorite ornament theme or color?**  
    Glass ornaments, with different colours. Nice mix :) 
 24. **Favorite for Christmas dinner?**  
    No idea really... 
 25. **What do you want for Christmas this year?**  
    Pressies! :p 
 26. **Who is least likely to respond to this?**  
    Ugh. No idea? 
 27. **Favorite thing about Christmas?**  
    Snow, cold weather, sitting inside with my gf in front of the fireplace ;)
