Yesterday, [Arthur C. Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke), author of [2001: A Space Oddysey"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey) and other great works, passed away at the age of 90. He'll be sorely missed both by the science community and the millions of fans he had. 

Today, [Hugo Claus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Claus), a Flemish novelist, poet, playwright, painter and film director, died at the age of 78. He was considered to be one of the most important contemporary Dutch language authors.

Sad week for the world! :(
