We went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236/" target="_blank">Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</a> the other week.. a good (if rather grim) musical!



The Lyrics of my favourite song from the movie you can find below!

**Musical: Sweeney Todd  
Song: A Little Priest**

**MRS. LOVETT**:  
Seems a downright shame...  
**TODD**: Shame?  
**LOVETT**:  
Seems an awful waste...  
Such a nice, plump frame  
Wot's 'is name has...  
Had...  
Has!  
Nor it can't be traced...  
Bus'ness needs a lift,  
Debts to be erased...  
Think of it as thrift,  
As a gift,  
If you get my drift!

No?

Seems an awful waste...  
I mean, with the price of meat  
What it is,  
When you get it,  
If you get it...

**TODD**: HAH!  
**LOVETT**:  
Good, you got it!

Take, for instance, Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop!  
Bus'ness never better using only pussycats and toast!  
And a pussy's good for maybe six or seven at the most!  
And I'm sure they can't compare as far as taste!

[Simultaneously]

**TODD**:  
Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion  
**LOVETT**:  
Well, it does seem a waste...

**TODD**:  
Eminently practical  
And yet appropriate as always!  
**LOVETT**:  
It's an idea...

**TODD**:  
Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived  
Without you all these years, I'll never know!  
How delectable!  
Also undetectable!  
**LOVETT**:  
Think about it!  
Lots of other gentlemen'll  
Soon be comin' for a shave,  
Won't they?  
Think of  
All them  
Pies!

**TODD**:  
How choice!

How Rare!

**TODD**:  
For what's the sound of the world out there?  
**LOVETT**:  
What, Mr. Todd?  
What, Mr. Todd?  
What is that sound?  
**TODD**:  
Those crunching noises pervading the air!  
**LOVETT**:  
Yes, Mr. Todd!  
Yes, Mr. Todd!  
Yes, all around!  
**TODD**:  
It's man devouring man, my dear!  
**BOTH**:  
And [**LOVETT**: Then] who are we to deny it in here?

**TODD**: (spoken) These are desperate times,  
Mrs. Lovett, and desperate measures are called for!  
**LOVETT**: Here we are, now! Hot out of the oven!  
**TODD**: What is that?

**LOVETT**:  
It's priest. Have a little priest.  
**TODD**:  
Is it really good?  
**LOVETT**:  
Sir, it's too good, at least!  
Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh,  
So it's pretty fresh.  
**TODD**:  
Awful lot of fat.  
**LOVETT**:  
Only where it sat.  
**TODD**:  
Haven't you got poet, or something like that?  
**LOVETT**:  
No, y'see, the trouble with poet is  
'Ow do you know it's deceased?  
Try the priest!

**TODD**: (spoken) Heavenly!  
Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps,  
but then again, not as bland as curate, either!

**LOVETT**:  
And good for business, too - always leaves you wantin' more!  
Trouble is, we only get it on Sundays!

Lawyer's rather nice.  
**TODD**:  
If it's for a price.  
**LOVETT**:  
Order something else, though, to follow,  
Since no one should swallow it twice!  
**TODD**:  
Anything that's lean.  
**LOVETT**:  
Well, then, if you're British and loyal,  
You might enjoy Royal Marine!  
Anyway, it's clean.  
Though of course, it tastes of wherever it's been!  
**TODD**:  
Is that squire,  
On the fire?  
**LOVETT**:  
Mercy no, sir, look closer,  
You'll notice it's grocer!  
**TODD**:  
Looks thicker,  
More like vicar!  
**LOVETT**:  
No, it has to be grocer -  
It's green!

**TODD**:  
The history of the world, my love -  
**LOVETT**:  
Save a lot of graves,  
Do a lot of relatives favors!  
**TODD**:  
Is those below serving those up above!  
**LOVETT**:  
Ev'rybody shaves,  
So there should be plenty of flavors!  
**TODD**:  
How gratifying for once to know  
**BOTH**:  
That those above will serve those down below!

**LOVETT**: (spoken) Now let's see, here... We've got tinker.  
**TODD**: Something... pinker.  
**LOVETT**: Tailor?  
**TODD**: Paler.  
**LOVETT**: Butler?  
**TODD**: Subtler.  
**LOVETT**: Potter?  
**TODD**: Hotter.  
**LOVETT**: Locksmith?

Lovely bit of clerk.  
**TODD**:  
Maybe for a lark.  
**LOVETT**:  
Then again there's sweep  
If you want it cheap  
And you like it dark!  
Try the financier,  
Peak of his career!  
**TODD**:  
That looks pretty rank.  
**LOVETT**:  
Well, he drank,  
It's a bank  
Cashier.  
Never really sold.  
Maybe it was old.  
**TODD**:  
Have you any Beadle?  
**LOVETT**:  
Next week, so I'm told!  
Beadle isn't bad till you smell it and  
Notice 'ow well it's been greased...  
Stick to priest!

(spoken) Now then, this might be a little bit stringy,  
but then of course it's... fiddle player!  
**TODD**: No, this isn't fiddle player - it's piccolo player!  
**LOVETT**: 'Ow can you tell?  
**TODD**: It's piping hot!  
**LOVETT**: Then blow on it first!

**TODD**:  
The history of the world, my sweet -  
**LOVETT**:  
Oh, Mr. Todd,  
Ooh, Mr. Todd,  
What does it tell?  
**TODD**:  
Is who gets eaten, and who gets to eat!  
**LOVETT**:  
And, Mr. Todd,  
Too, Mr. Todd,  
Who gets to sell!  
**TODD**:  
But fortunately, it's also clear  
**BOTH**:  
That [L: But] ev'rybody goes down well with beer!

**LOVETT**: (spoken)  
Since marine doesn't appeal to you, 'ow about... rear admiral?  
**TODD**: Too salty. I prefer general.  
**LOVETT**: With, or without his privates? "With" is extra.

**TODD**: What is that?  
**LOVETT**:  
It's fop.  
Finest in the shop.  
And we have some shepherd's pie peppered  
With actual shepherd on top!  
And I've just begun -  
Here's the politician, so oily  
It's served with a doily,  
Have one!  
**TODD**:  
Put it on a bun.  
Well, you never know if it's going to run!  
**LOVETT**:  
Try the friar,  
Fried, it's drier!  
**TODD**:  
No, the clergy is really  
Too coarse and too mealy!  
**LOVETT**:  
Then actor,  
That's compacter!  
**TODD**:  
Yes, and always arrives overdone!  
I'll come again when you have JUDGE on the menu!

**LOVETT**: (spoken) Wait! True, we don't have judge yet,  
but we've got something you might fancy even better.  
**TODD**: What's that?  
**LOVETT**: Executioner!

**TODD**:  
Have charity towards the world, my pet!  
**LOVETT**:  
Yes, yes, I know, my love!  
**TODD**:  
We'll take the customers that we can get!  
**LOVETT**:  
High-born and low, my love!  
**TODD**:  
We'll not discriminate great from small!  
No, we'll serve anyone,  
Meaning anyone,  
**BOTH**:  
And to anyone  
At all!
