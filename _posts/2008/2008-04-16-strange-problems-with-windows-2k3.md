I'm wondering if anyone out there can help me with this one...

On one server, running Windows server 2003 R2 Enterprise x64 Edition, service pack 1, I'm encountering this problem:

The machine often grinds to a halt, responding very slowly, and the event log is filled with:

Application log:

> Event Source: PerfOS  
> Event Category: None

The only thing this machine is running is [Platform Symphony](http://www.platform.com), GRID computing software. This setup is identical on 4 other machines, which don't show any problems.

After numerous googles I still haven't found a reason or a solution. I've tried:

  * reinstalling machine - problem comes back (it's not clear before or after installing the GRID software...
  * increasing pagefile size
  * checked main drive
  * tried UHCleaner - doesn't seem to work on 64bit
  * checked registry settings - all are identical
