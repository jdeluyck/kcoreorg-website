Mostly because I keep forgetting&#8230;

Type in the following codes to find out:

  * WLAN MAC address: *#62209526#
  * Bluetooth MAC address: *#2820#
  * Software version and release number of the device: *#0000#
  * EMEI: *#06#

To do a hard reset (full erase + reset to factory settings); type *#7370# (look in your manual for the default access code)
