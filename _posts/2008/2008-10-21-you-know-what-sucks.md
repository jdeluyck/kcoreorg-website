... waking up at 6 in the morning, because you hear a certain sound you associate with water that's coming under high pressure from a tap.

Upon closer inspection, the tap in the shower was spraying hot water from one of the sides. Luckely, the shower door was closed, or the bathroom would have been flooded.

After shutting down the water flow and removing the tap, we found this:

Broken tap

Side which is still good (cold water)

Side which is broken (hot water)

It basically cleanly split off from the tube, causing the place to be sprayed in hot water. Fun, not. Goddamn shoddy quality products!!
