At work we regularly have to send over files to $vendor. $Vendor has two ways of accepting files: [FTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), and [Webdav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) (over [https](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https)). Since our company's policy is to not send things out unencrypted, we have to go the webdav way. It's also the policy to send things over our internetproxy if possible.

After some searching for a console-based webdav client we ran across [cadaver](http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/), a lightweight client that seemed to do the trick. It has proxy support, so great ;)

What isn't so great is that it doesn't have any way to supply the proxy authentication in a non-interactive way, which is crucial to allow us to script this file transfer.

Today I took the time to create a [patch](http://lists.manyfish.co.uk/pipermail/cadaver/2008-October/000035.html) that allows just that - setting the proxy info in advance. It also includes a parameter to trust the server certificate implicitly, otherwise it was yet another step where cadaver would come and ask for user input.

Now it works like a charm! :)
