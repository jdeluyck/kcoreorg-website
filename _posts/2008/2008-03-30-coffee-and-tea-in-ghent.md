Yesterday, when walking through Ghent, we discovered a new shop specialised in coffee and tea: [Simon L&eacute;velt](http://www.simonlevelt.nl/KoffieWinkel/Products.aspx?coi=3021&pg=3917) on the [Kleine Vismarkt (nr. 5) in Ghent](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Kleine+Vismarkt,+9000+Gent,+Gent&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=35.957999,77.431641&ie=UTF8&z=16). It's a small shop easily passed, but really worth a visit.

From their choices we took home a 250g package of "[Espresso Del Barista Bio](http://www.simonlevelt.nl/KoffieWinkel/Products.aspx?coi=3021&pg=3917)" (espresso of the espressomaster), and a package of [Pai Mu Tan](http://www.simonlevelt.nl/TheeWinkel/Products.aspx?coi=2095), white chinese tea. We also got a freebee: [Whitepoint mix](http://www.simonlevelt.nl/TheeWinkel/Products.aspx?coi=2276), a tea mix of [Bai Hao Yenzhen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Hao_Yinzhen_tea) tea and [Oolong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolong_tea) tea.

We just had a cup of the coffee - it's close to the best espresso we've had ever.
