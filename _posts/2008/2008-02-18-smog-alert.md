Today the government of Flanders imposed another "Smog alert", atleast until tomorrow evening.

![Smog!](/assets/images/2008/02/large_220795.jpg "Smog!")

What is this, you might ask?When the amount of [fine dust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulate) in the air exceeds the european limit (40 µg/m³), a speed limit of 90 kph is imposed on certain roads, to reduce this.

As posted by Wim in [this post (in dutch), about the smog-alert end of 2007](http://www.wimblog.be/smogalarm/), this is actually quite moot - you drive less fast for 3-4 days in a year, but keep polluting the same all the other days. It's also only mandatory in flanders, not in wallonia (go figure).

Also, completely accidental, the amount of speed-checks increases tenfold, and there's the zero-tolerance.

I do agree that we need to do something about this problem - but not the short half-assed "solution" our government imposes (drive slower for 2 days) which only serves to increase their revenue through speeding tickets - but a real structural solution. Like:

  * higher taxes on the polluting cars
  * promoting the ecologically sound cards
  * making public transport usable for more people

I'm sure there are a lot more options, but these would be a start...
