I'm currently trying to get Linux (Debian Sid) working on my MacBook... it's installed, but still needs lots of tweaking.

Most of the things work out of the box, except the things listed below:

Specific things that work (after tweaking):

  * Xorg with resolution at 1280x800
  * WiFi (atheros)
  * special buttons (volume/brightness/...)

Things that need to work still:

  * Touchpad (well, it works, but it needs to work better)
  * iSight

Sources I'm using at the moment:

  * [http://wiki.debian.org/MacBook](http://wiki.debian.org/MacBook)
  * [http://wikigentoo.ksiezyc.pl/Apple_Mac_Pro.htm](http://wikigentoo.ksiezyc.pl/Apple_Mac_Pro.htm)

I'll write a detailed post on this later... when I'm not uberly lazy ;)
