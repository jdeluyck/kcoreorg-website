I need some sleep.  
I can’t go on like this.  
I try counting sheep,  
But there’s one I always miss. 
  
Everyone says I’m getting down too low    
Everyone says: "You just gotta let it go"  
"You just gotta let it go"  
I just gotta let it go
  
  
I need some sleep  
time to put the old horse down  
I’m in too deep  
and the wheels keep spinning round

Everyone says I’m getting down too low  
Everyone says: "You just gotta let it go"  
"You just gotta let it go"  
I just gotta let it go
  
  
You just gotta let it go    
You just gotta let it go  
You just gotta let it go
