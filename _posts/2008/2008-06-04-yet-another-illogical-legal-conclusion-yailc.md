In another episode of totally wonky legal battles, [eBay](http://www.ebay.com) was [found guilty](http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ieVhlM9xNEzcmDtrdw6ToFLtkRAg) of selling counterfeit [Hermes](http://www.hermes.com/) handbags by a french court.

So, let me get this straight:

  * Person A sells something on eBay that's a fake
  * Person B buys said fake
  * Person B finds out it's a fake, and instead of taking it up with the seller attacks the company that's a mere falicitator of online auctions...
  * ... and the french courts follow him?!??
Me no comprendo.
