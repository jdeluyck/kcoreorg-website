I recently acquired a [Mac Mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini/), which I'm going to use as a [PVR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PVR).

Together with an [Elgato](http://www.elgato.com/) [EyeTV Hybrid](http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/hybrid.en.html) it works perfectly, attached to my good old analogue 21" Sony TV .

Sofar it seems to work fine, using a DVI-to-svideo convertor. I've installed the EyeTV software, the [PyeTV](http://code.google.com/p/pyetv/) [Front Row](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row) plugin (which allows me to controle EyeTV from within Front Row) and [Perian](http://perian.org/) (for more codec support in Front Row)
