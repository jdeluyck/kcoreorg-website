Another black day for the world: G. W. Bush won the 2004 elections. Great. Fantastic! Now we're atleast sure that the US will be hated even more throughout the world than it already is... Wonder what stupid decisions he'll make this time. Perhaps rule that the US is the only power in the world that should be allowed nuclear weapons, and that every country that doesn't do it's bidding must be attacked preemptively to hunt down non-existing terrorists?

What a load of cr*p.
