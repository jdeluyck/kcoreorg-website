[Reason]  
Think hard, you are lying here in a hospital bed  
Disregard the emotions inside your head  
Concentrate on the real world beyond your mind  
It's not to late to leave your burdens behind

[Fear] We won't let you go  
Take you down below  
Dark crypts of your soul  
Locked inside your head  
You're better of dead

[Agony] Locked away, she lives in isolation  
It's been that way, since he has gone  
She been through life of depravation  
She depends on you, her only son

[Passion] She won't let you go  
Keep you down below  
Dark crypts of your soul  
Locked inside your head  
You're better of dead

[Agony] Where are you, can't you hear her calling?  
Nothing you can do, you have no time  
There is no one there, to catch her now she's falling  
Why should you care, you are doing fine

(Chorus 1 - Passion)

[Reason] Now she's at rest, she finally found her peace  
There's no need to blame yourself  
You must let go, or the pain will never cease  
It's time to crawl out of your shell

Your mother died, the day your father left  
A part of you died as well  
Feelings of guilt will haunt you 'til the end  
You must fight hard to break this spell

But it hurts....

[Fear] You hear her voice, from beyond her grave  
- Where were you son, when I needed you  
Is this your thanks for all the warmth I gave  
- Did you forget what I been through?

You hear his voice, cold and merciless  
- You worthless fool, you let her die!  
And deep within yourself, you must confess  
Your ways cannot be justified

[Pride] By now you realized, you have to be  
relentless to survive  
Repress your memories,  
bury all emotions and thrive!  
It's your life!

[Reason] Now she's at rest, she found her peace  
[Fear] You hear her voice, from the grave  
[Reason] You must let go or the pain won't cease  
[Fear] Is this your thanks for all I gave  
[Reason] A part of you died as well  
[Fear] You worthless fool, you let her die  
[Reason] It's time to crawl out of your shell  
[Fear] Your ways cannot be justified

(Chorus 2 - Pride)
