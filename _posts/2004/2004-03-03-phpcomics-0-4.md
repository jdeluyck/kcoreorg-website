This is a collection of scripts that allow you to download complete archives of web-published comics.

## Usage

First off, to actually run this script you must tell it where the php binary is. Edit `phpcomics.php` and modify the first line to `#!/path/to/php4 -q`. On Debian Sid, this is `/usr/bin/php4.`

Then, edit the script for the comic you want to download, modifying these parameters:

  * $start_year = _start-year_
  * $start_month = _start-month_
  * $start_day = _start-day_
  * $end_year = _end-year_
  * $end_month = _end-month_
  * $end_day = _end-day_

or you can leave them to their default settings, which will get everything from the start of the archive to the current date.

## Requirements

*  PHP
* wget (optional but recommended)
