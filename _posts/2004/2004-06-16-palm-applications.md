Hmmm... In my quest for useless applications to put on a Palm, I've come across [SSH2 for Palm](http://www.sealiesoftware.com/pssh/) - an SSH2 client, [PalmVNC](http://palmvnc2.free.fr/) - a VNC client ;p and [upIRC](http://www.smittyware.com/palm/upirc/) - an IRC client.... totally pointless to have on a palm if you don't have a flatrate gprs connection or the like. ;p

I love it ;)
