I've spent the last 12 days together with my lovely girlfriend... Travelled off to Spain 
last week on wednesday, to find her in Barajas Airport. she came together with her mum to 
pick me up :) Had a lovely stay at the Abba Hoteles in the Pza. de Castillia, tho the 
elevators are a bit noisy there :(

I went along with her to uni, followed classes (tho I understood perhaps 1/10th of it, my 
spanish ain't to good yet :\|, and it's complex matter), stayed some time at her home and so... 

On friday 'eve we baked cookies together, and on saturday we flew off back to Belgium 
together... Watch out .be, here we come :P

Saturday evening I took her to meet some friends of mine, and en groupe we went to have 
dinner in a local Chinese restaurant, lovely dinner :).

Sunday was a relaxed day, more or less, with my sis + friend + kiddo's coming over to my 
parent's place.. We watched some old photographs (oh, the sentiment! The memories \*snif\*) 
but had a nice time on the whole...

On monday we went to Li&egrave;ge, saw the Christmas market there (lovely) and walked about 
a bit... 

Tuesday we went to visit a friend in Maasmechelen, David... we met up at a shopping 
village (??!? - didn't know that existed), and we trondled off to Maastricht, saw the 
Christmas market there too (boooo - crappy one) and had some drinks (after looking for half 
an hour to find a place to drink something, everything closes even at 6pm!!)

Wednesday was a bit quieter (stayed at home mostly), in the eve we went to Ghent, for xmas 
shopping, looking at the then-closed market... then went to Bruges, where the xmas-market
was closed half already (only food and booze ones were still open), and back to Ghent for
dinner in a veggy restaurant.

On thursday we drove all the way to Luxembourg (city, in Luxembourg country) were we met up 
with a Fenfen, a good friend... Had a nice time freezing and getting lost.. the old city 
looks nice, but everything closes too early. Guess it's better during summer when it's 
warm ;p

On friday we stayed home mostly, we baked cookies (mjummmy ;p), in the eve we went to Ghent 
for dinner in another veggy restaurant, and afterwards picking 
along "[The Incredibles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/)", phun movie ;)

Saturday was very quiet, only a quick stop in Ghent to see the then-open christmas market, 
and to Bruges to get chocolates! CHOCOLATE RULES! :) :) >:) \*cough\* sowwy, got carried away. ;p

And today.. sunday.. well, we woke up, then packed her suitcase, since she has to go back 
home .. :( It was a very quiet day otherwise, and I drove her to the airport where she 
departed then at 17.25 to Madrid...

Miss you a lot, love, more then ever after this lovely time together.
