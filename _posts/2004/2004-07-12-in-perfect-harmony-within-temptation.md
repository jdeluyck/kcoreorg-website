In a world so far away  
At the end of a closing day  
A little child was born and raised  
Deep in the forest on a hidden place  
Mother never saw his face

Ancient spirits of the forest  
Made him king of elves and trees  
He was the only human being  
Who lived in harmony  
In perfect harmony

The woods protected, fulfillled his needs  
Fruit by birds, honey by bees  
He found shelter under trees  
He grew up in their company  
They became his family

Ancient spirits of the forest  
Made him king of elves and trees  
He was the only human being  
Who lived in harmony  
In perfect harmony

A thousand seasons  
They passed him by  
So many times, have said goodbye  
And when the spirits called out his name  
To join forever, forever to stay  
A forest spirit he became

Ancient spirits of the forest  
Made him king of elves and trees  
He was the only human being  
Who lived in harmony  
In perfect harmony
