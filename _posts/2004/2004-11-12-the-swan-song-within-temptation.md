Winter has come for me, can't carry on.  
The chains to my life are strong but soon they'll be gone.  
I'll spread my wings one more time.

Is it a dream?  
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.  
The sun warms my face.  
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.

In my heart I know I can let go.  
In the end I will find some peace inside.  
New wings are growing tonight.

Is it a dream?  
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.  
The sun warms my face.  
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.

As I am soaring I'm one with the wind.  
I am longing to see you again, it's been so long.  
We will be together again.

Is it a dream?  
All the ones I have loved calling out my name.  
The sun warms my face.  
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by.
