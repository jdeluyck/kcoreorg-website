I've often wondered if there's a point to so many things we do, we say, we see. More than once I've come to conclude that many things we do are just for the masses, for the appeasing of the public that surrounds us. Looks are everything, who gives a flying fuck about the person underneath these days?

As long as you behave in a way people expect you to behave, and you are a good boy/girl, they'll accept you. Step out of line once, they'll be all over you like vultures, stealing what they can before dropping you like a left-over of yesterdays's dinner.

I hate it.

New music: Celtic Requiem. Kinda sad.
