Oi!

Wednesday our half-yearly Lanparty starts... it's the ninth one we're organising, and, for the first time, I'm not really 100% looking forward to it. I have so many other things to do.. still, it'll be a time of relaxation and just 'letting loose'.. 

GOOD OLD FRAGFEST!!!!

Playing games for 5 days, 'till sunday. w00t.
