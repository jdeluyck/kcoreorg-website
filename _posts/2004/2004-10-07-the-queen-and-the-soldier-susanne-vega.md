The soldier came knocking upon the queen's door  
He said, "I am not fighting for you any more"  
The queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before  
And slowly she let him inside.

He said, "I've watched your palace up here on the hill  
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill  
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will  
Only first I am asking you why. "

Down in the long narrow hall he was led  
Into her rooms with her tapestries red  
And she never once took the crown from her head  
She asked him there to sit down.

He said, "I see you now, and you are so very young  
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won  
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun  
And now will you tell me why?"

The young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye  
She said, "You won't understand, and you may as well not try"  
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry  
But she closed herself up like a fan.

And she said, "I've swallowed a secret burning thread  
It cuts me inside, and often I've bled"  
He laid his hand then on top of her head  
And he bowed her down to the ground.

"Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel  
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed  
But I won't march again on your battlefield"  
And he took her to the window to see.

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray  
And she wanted more than she ever could say  
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away  
And would not look at his face again.

And he said, "I want to live as an honest man  
To get all I deserve and to give all I can  
And to love a young woman who I don't understand  
Your highness, your ways are very strange. "

But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break  
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached  
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait  
She would only be a moment inside.

Out in the distance her order was heard  
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word  
And while the queen went on strangeling in the solitude she preferred  
The battle continued on...
