Well, what can I say? Best of wishes to everyone for 2005, and hopefully less violence/war/stupidity/suffering in the world.. Tho we really didn't start of well, with the disaster that happened (and the medical disaster that's starting to happen now) in the middle east with the Tsunami.. I hope that solutions are worked out quickly to make sure the needs get resolved...

On a more personal note, I spent last new years with my lovely girlfriend for the first time, was one of the best ones sofar :) but as usual, it's a pain to have to watch her go away again after spending a week together...

Next time I'll be seeing her will be in february, on the 18th, with her exams and all...

We spent the week mostly at home, enjoying each others company and doing 'normal couple stuff', like groceries, watching a movie, ... We went to a verry nice greek restaurant too, called Zorba, with live music and very attentive waiters.. A real treat ;)

Otherwise the period has been very calm...
