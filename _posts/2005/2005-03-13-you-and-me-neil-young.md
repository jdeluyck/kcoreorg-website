Open up your eyes  
See how life time flies  
Open up and let the light back in.

Open up your heart  
Let the lovin' start  
Open up and let the light back in.

I was thinking of you and me  
Makin' love beneath the tree  
And now I wonder could it be.

Thinkin' 'bout the times we had  
Some were good and some were bad  
Guitar fightin' the T.V.

I was thinkin' 'bout you and me  
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me  
I was thinkin' of you and me  
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me.

Lookin' at you just the other night  
Dancin' in the evening light  
True love conquers all.

Old man sittin' there  
Touch of grey, but he don't care  
When he hears his children call.

I was thinkin' 'bout you and me  
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me  
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me  
I was thinkin' 'bout you and me.

Open up your eyes  
See how life time flies  
Open up and let the light back in.
