Okay, first time I spend an entire night at work, because of a multicast routing problem. It took us a while to diagnose and to figure out where it went wrong and why it did... And having spent a 12h shift before, and then after would've been quite deadly ;p

We got a temporary fix in place in the end, tho the real cause still needs investigating (don't you love multicast - NOT)
