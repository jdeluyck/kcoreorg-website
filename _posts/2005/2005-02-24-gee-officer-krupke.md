**ACTION**  
Dear kindly Sergeant Krupke,  
You gotta understand,  
It's just our bringin' up-ke  
That gets us out of hand.  
Our mothers all are junkies,  
Our fathers all are drunks.  
Golly Moses, natcherly we're punks! 

**ACTION AND JETS**  
Gee, Officer Krupke, we're very upset;  
We never had the love that ev'ry child oughta get.  
We ain't no delinquents,  
We're misunderstood.  
Deep down inside us there is good! 

**ACTION**  
There is good! 

**ALL**  
There is good, there is good,  
There is untapped good!  
Like inside, the worst of us is good! 

**SNOWBOY**: (Spoken) That's a touchin' good story. 

**ACTION**: (Spoken) Lemme tell it to the world! 

**SNOWBOY**: Just tell it to the judge. 

**ACTION**  
Dear kindly Judge, your Honor,  
My parents treat me rough.  
With all their marijuana,  
They won't give me a puff.  
They didn't wanna have me,  
But somehow I was had.  
Leapin' lizards! That's why I'm so bad! 

**DIESEL**: (As Judge) Right! 

Officer Krupke, you're really a square;  
This boy don't need a judge, he needs an analyst's care!  
It's just his neurosis that oughta be curbed.  
He's psychologic'ly disturbed! 

**ACTION**  
I'm disturbed! 

**JETS**  
We're disturbed, we're disturbed,  
We're the most disturbed,  
Like we're psychologic'ly disturbed. 

**DIESEL**: (Spoken, as Judge) In the opinion on this court, this child is depraved on account he ain't had a normal home. 

**ACTION**: (Spoken) Hey, I'm depraved on account I'm deprived. 

**DIESEL**: So take him to a headshrinker. 

**ACTION** (Sings)  
My father is a bastard,  
My ma's an S.O.B.  
My grandpa's always plastered,  
My grandma pushes tea.  
My sister wears a mustache,  
My brother wears a dress.  
Goodness gracious, that's why I'm a mess! 

**A-RAB**: (As Psychiatrist) Yes!  
Officer Krupke, you're really a slob.  
This boy don't need a doctor, just a good honest job.  
Society's played him a terrible trick,  
And sociologic'ly he's sick! 

**ACTION**  
I am sick! 

**ALL**  
We are sick, we are sick,  
We are sick, sick, sick,  
Like we're sociologically sick! 

**A-RAB**: In my opinion, this child don't need to have his head shrunk at all. Juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease! 

**ACTION**: Hey, I got a social disease! 

**A-RAB**: So take him to a social worker! 

**ACTION**  
Dear kindly social worker,  
They say go earn a buck.  
Like be a soda jerker,  
Which means like be a schumck.  
It's not I'm anti-social,  
I'm only anti-work.  
Gloryosky! That's why I'm a jerk! 

**BABY JOHN**: (As Female Social Worker)  
Eek!  
Officer Krupke, you've done it again.  
This boy don't need a job, he needs a year in the pen.  
It ain't just a question of misunderstood;  
Deep down inside him, he's no good! 

**ACTION**  
I'm no good! 

**ALL**  
We're no good, we're no good!  
We're no earthly good,  
Like the best of us is no damn good! 

**DIESEL** (As Judge)  
The trouble is he's crazy. 

**A-RAB** (As Psychiatrist)  
The trouble is he drinks. 

**BABY JOHN** (As Female Social Worker)  
The trouble is he's lazy. 

**DIESEL**  
The trouble is he stinks. 

**A-RAB**  
The trouble is he's growing. 

**BABY JOHN**  
The trouble is he's grown. 

**ALL**  
Krupke, we got troubles of our own! 

Gee, Officer Krupke,  
We're down on our knees,  
'Cause no one wants a fellow with a social disease.  
Gee, Officer Krupke,  
What are we to do?  
Gee, Officer Krupke,  
Krup you!
