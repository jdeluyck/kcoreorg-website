teleMon is a script that you can use to monitor transfer rates. Originally it was written to keep track of the usage on the 
Telenet ISP Network, but now [phptelemeter](https://phptelemeter.kcore.org) can be used for that.

## Installation

### Preparations

* Edit the `include/settings.inc.php` file. Comments are included in this config file.  
  Edit the first line of getStats.php to reflect the path to the php cgi binary (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/php`)  
  Make sure getStats.php is executable! (else do `chmod +x getStats.php`)

### The teleMon agent:

As root, install the following crontab:  
`0 * * * * /path/to/getStats.php`

This will instruct crond to run getStats.php each hour to retrieve the statistics. If you want, you can change the interval to something else.

You will also have to install the script somewhere into your system's shutdown procedure.

### Prepare iptables

As root, run the setrules.sh script to install the needed iptables rules. This will have to be done each time the pc is rebooted, so I suggest installing this in your bootup scripts. (see your distributions manual for this)

## Usage

Surf to the url where you installed the pages, after configuring the settings.inc.php file.

## Requirements

* PHP
* iptables

## Latest release

The last release is version 0.9, and can be downloaded [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=46385&package_id=39203)
