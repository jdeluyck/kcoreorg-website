On the [HTC Desire S](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_s-3776.php), I've been using an 
[unofficial build](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2031694) 
(made by [Flinny](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4350964)) of 
[CyanogenMod 10](http://cyanogenmod.com/) for a while - happily so.  

Unfortunately the author is/was a bit strapped for time, and development slowed down 
significantly at the time. Updates for CM 10.1 and later were not forthcoming.  
Since I'm enough of a geek, and suffering from [ORD](http://www.xda-developers.com/announcements/do-you-have-obsessive-rom-updating-disorder-ord/),
I decided to try to 'roll my own': to compile CM from source. As it turned out, it's not 
quite as hard as you'd think it is.

~~First, you need to~~I was going to write a lengthy tutorial here, but there are plenty of 
tutorials out there. 
So instead of inventing the wheel yet again, you can just go look at 
[this one](http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-4/general/guide-cm11-how-to-build-cyanogenmod-11-t2515305), or 
[here](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Development) or 
[here](http://www.usoftphone.com/t115104.html). 
Or you can just go and [Google it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=building+cm+from+source) ;)

You can find the thread for [my unofficial builds](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2467013) on [XDA Developers](http://www.xda-developers.com/).  
The [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) repository with all my sources can be found [here](http://github.com/jdeluyck/), on GitHub.
