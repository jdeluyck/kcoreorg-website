An update on the ["My history in gadgets"](/2012/01/04/my-history-in-gadgets/) post from a while back, as things have progressed a bit meanwhile ;)

**_Mobile phone history:_**

I've since sold my Desire, and obtained/sold the following phones:

**[HTC Desire HD](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_hd-3468.php)   
![HTC Desire HD](/assets/images/2014/05/htc-desire-hd-new-1.jpg "HTC Desire HD")**    
Bought this phone secondhand, used it for a while. Quite the powerhorse for the specs, the only downside being it's weight. Was also temporarily used by my girlfriend. Sold it on in 2013.

**[HTC Desire S](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_s-3776.php)

Purchased this one also secondhand for my girlfriend. After a while it returned to me and is currently in use as my work phone.

**[HTC One X](http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_desire_s-3776.php)  
![HTC One X](/assets/images/2014/05/htc-one-x-1.jpg "HTC One X")**  
After selling the Desire HD, I got the HTC One X secondhand in 2012. This one features a quadcore Tegra3, and it's just amazing in speed and display specs. Sold it on in 2014.

**[LG Nexus 5](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_5-5705.php)   
![LG Nexus 5](/assets/images/2014/05/lg-google-nexus-5-1.jpg "LG Nexus 5")**  
This is my current main phone.
