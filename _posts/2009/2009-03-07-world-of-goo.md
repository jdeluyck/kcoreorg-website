A good friend of mine introduced me to a new game: [World Of Goo!](http://www.worldofgoo.com)

I've finished the demo, and it's damned addictive ;)

There are [user levels](http://worldofgoo.no.sapo.pt/) available too, so the gameplay isn't limited to the game itself ;)

And, as a nice bonus: It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux!
