I've just released [phptelemeter 1.35](http://phptelemeter.kcore.org/). This version only has a few changes, but I wanted to get it out there:

  * Added support for Mobile Vikings
  * Added unlimited support for Dommel accounts bug report: 2886030)

As per usual, you can download it from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter).
