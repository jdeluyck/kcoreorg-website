I bought an <a href="http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/hybrid/product1.en.html" target="_blank">Elgato EyeTV Hybrid</a> a <a href="https://kcore.org/2008/09/19/mac-mini-pvr/" target="_blank">while back</a>, and I was using the <a href="http://www.tvtv.co.uk" target="_blank">tvtv.co.uk</a> service to get my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_program_guide" target="_blank">EPG</a>(Electronic Program Guide) data.

This, however, and unfortunately, stopped updating for Belgian channels on the 1st of january. Shitty, since I use that data to have EyeTV automatically record stuff for me. I've contacted tvtv, no reaction sofar.

Since the EyeTV has no other built-in EPG data supplier that I can use, I looked for an <a href="http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">XMLTV</a> grabber for Belgium. The grabbers that existed unfortunately didn't work anymore because they depend on the Teveblad.be website, which no longer allows screenscrapers. Bummer.

Fortunately, thanks to the magical interwebs, I stumbled on <a href="http://mc2xml.110mb.com/" target="_blank">mc2xml</a>, a Media Center TV Listings to XMLTV convertor. It downloads media center, titantv, or schedules direct tv listings and outputs an XMLTV formatted xml file, which I can feed to EyeTV. And now I have my schedule info again! ;)
