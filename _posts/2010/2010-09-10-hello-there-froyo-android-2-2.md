Google released Android 2.2 - codename Froyo (for [Frozen Yoghurt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_yogurt)), giving Android users a nice speedboost.

Unfortunately, HTC decided they're not going to release Froyo for the trusty old HTC Hero. And since I have one of those, I'm basically screwed.

Luckely, Google also releases the source code of Android, known as the [Android Open Source Project](http://source.android.com/) (AOSP in short). And the fine folk at [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/) and [VillainROM](http://www.villainrom.co.uk) took that source and baked it into something that works on our Hero's: [FroydVillain (1.5)](http://www.villainrom.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?2358-FroydVillain-1.5.0-quot-So-fast-it-waits-for-YOU-to-boot). A damn fast, optimized for the Hero ROM.

The downside? This is a naked Android ROM, so no [HTC Sense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Sense) goodies. There are plenty of replacements in the Android Market though, like [LauncherPro (Plus)](http://www.launcherpro.com) with it's new widgets, [Dolphin HD](http://home.dolphin-browser.com/tunny/Home.htm) browser, and many more.

I've been running it since and I'm very happy with it!
