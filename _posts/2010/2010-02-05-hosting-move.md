I've moved hosting, from [Lunar Pages](http://www.lunarpages.com/) to [OVH](http://www.ovh.co.uk). Lunar Pages is a good hosting, but their [overselling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling#Web_Hosting) and price hikes in the last few years made me look for something else. 

Other reasons: 

  * speed: transfers are a LOT faster (especially in peak hours)
  * SSH access ;)
  * Full DNS zone access
  * Cheaper prices for domain names
  * ...

If you encounter any oddities, feel free to let me know...
