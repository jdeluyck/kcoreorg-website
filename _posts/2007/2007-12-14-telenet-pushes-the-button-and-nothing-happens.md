[![Telenet drukt op de knop][img]][url]

[Telenet](http://www.telenet.be) has launched a big campaign, known as [Telenet drukt op de knop](http://www.telenetdruktopdeknop.be) (Telenet pushes the button) touting that their product line would be dramatically altered. Rumours flew around like a scrapping of the limits they impose, doubling of speeds, ...

In the end, it's basically just a big non-event: they multiplied the speed of their lowest subscription by 4, going from 256kbit to 1mbit... but keeping the ultra-low limit of 400 megabytes. Yes, that's correct, megabytes.  
They also increased the upload speed of the other subscriptions.

So now these people will be able to get a lot faster on smallband (56kbit connection), or buy blocks to increase their limits... and increase Telenet's revenues - ofcourse!
