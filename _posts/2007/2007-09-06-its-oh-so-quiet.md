Yeah, yeah, I know, that title is about the lamest I could come up with. It's appropriate though - since yesterday evening the main source of background noise when my pc is on is no longer my pc! I finally decided to get that noisebucket tamed, after hearing my brother-in-law's new computer (or better, the lack of hearing it).

I replaced my old [Atrix C9001-C4](http://www.aone.co.uk/ProdInfo.ASP?ProductID=44)  ([pic](/assets/images/2007/09/atrix.jpg)) case (which looks cool but is not that cool, you get tired of those fancy leds VERY quickly) with an [Antec Sonata III](http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=15137) ([pic](/assets/images/2007/09/sonataIII.jpg)), and replacing my old [boxed AMD CPU cooler ](/assets/images/2007/09/amd_boxed.jpg) with a [Scythe Katana 2](http://www.scythe-usa.com/product/cpu/030/scktn2000_detail.html) CPU cooler ([pic](/assets/images/2007/09/scythe_katana_2.jpg)).

The difference this made to my background noise level is amazing. The noisiest things now are my harddisks... let's go find some mufflers!
