Apple has confirmed the 26th as the releasedate for Leopard!

[![Mac OS X - Arriving 26th!][img]][url]

I've already preordered my copy of this operating system, which has [over 300 improvements](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html).

Now go [order yours](http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/intlstoreroutingpage.html?cid=AOSA10000022132)! ;) (just kidding ;p)
