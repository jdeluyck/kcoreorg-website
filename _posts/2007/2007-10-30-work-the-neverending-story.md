Well,

I [wrote](https://kcore.org/2007/09/30/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/) earlier that I was going to start with CTG, that story has gone a bit awry.

During my 2-week vacation in Spain (more about that [here](https://kcore.org/2007/10/30/come-flush-with-us/)) I was contacted by [KBC](http://www.kbc.be) and they made me a proposal which I accepted. So, I'm going to work at a bank, for a bank! Scary! :p (damn, I'm going to get all mature and old....)
