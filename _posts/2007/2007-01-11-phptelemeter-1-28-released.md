I've just released phptelemeter 1.28. This version includes the following changes:

  * New parameter: ignore_errors, makes phptelemeter ignore any runtime errors (instead of quitting).
  * Splitted off all common publisher stuff into a new parent class.
  * Fixed warnings/notices that appear when php is run with E_ALL error reporting.
  * Removed useless variable from parser_telemeter4tools
  * Fixed error handling in scarlet_web parser
  * Fixed off-by-one bug in the last day before reset in the scarlet_web parser.

As per usual, you can download it from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter).
