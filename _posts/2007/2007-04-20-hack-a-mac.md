Anyone want to Hack a Mac and get paid for it? Well, [now you can](http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9710845-7.html):

> TippingPoint, which runs the Zero Day Initiative bug bounty program, is offering to pay $10,000 to the hacker who commandeers one of two MacBooks. The target computers are connected to a wireless access point and fully patched, including the update for 25 vulnerabilities that Apple released on Thursday.

**EDIT:**
