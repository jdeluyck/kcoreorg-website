Today we went Karting with [work](http://www.triennium.com/) in [Brussels Kart](http://www.brusselskart.be), a karting / expo / restaurant thing in Groot-bijgaarden (just outside of Brussels).

It was a fun event, though I couldn't participate in the karting itself (bad stomach aches / sickness for a few days, and I doubt they wanted to redecorate their karting track). In the end, the oldest guys from [the team](/assets/images/2007/05/IMG_3400-me.jpg) won :p

Afterwards we had a nice dinner there too. I hadn't expected the restaurant to be so classy (including penguin-style personal table waiter), and the food was deliceous. I opted for \_the\_ veggy dish of the restaurant, which was [veggies with tofu](/assets/images/2007/05/IMG_3406-me.jpg).

All the incriminating evidence can be found [here](http://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/79-carting).
