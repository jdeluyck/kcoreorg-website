Yesterday I went to [FEM Computer Systems](http://www.fem.be/) in Aalst, Belgium - a local computer store that sells PC's and Apple stuff. After my [wonderful time](/2007/03/14/switch-no-thanks/) in another store, I was kinda weary, but for nothing :) The service is great, they treat people like they should be treated :)

So, after half an hour, I walked out with a paper with the following lines (of an order) on it:

| Item | # | 
| --- | --- | 
| MACBOOK DC2/2.00/SD/QWNL APPLE | 1.00 |
| MEMORY 1024MB IMACINTEL 1.8/2.0 KINGSTON | 2.00 |
| MEMORY 512MB IMACINTEL 1.8/2.0 KINGSTON | -2.00 |

And today, around 11:50, they called to let me know that [the machine](http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html) is ready! Wheeeeeeeeeee! And VERY fast!  
Too bad that I've got to work until 19:00 today, and the shop closes at 18:00... so well, picking it up tomorrow :D
