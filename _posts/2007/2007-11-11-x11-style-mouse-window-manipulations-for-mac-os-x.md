In short, I finally found a way to manipulate windows under Mac OS X like you can in X11:

  * ALT+left mouse button: move window around
  * ALT+right mouse button: resize window

Well, [NuclearMouse](http://developers-club.com/posts/59968/) (a [SIMBL](http://culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) plugin) makes it happen!
