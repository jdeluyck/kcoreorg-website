Grmble.

Yesterday I picked up my macbook, which [recently returned from repair](https://kcore.org/2007/11/09/my-mac-is-back/), and a screw fell out. wtf?

I checked, you can't tighten it, seems the internal socket where the screw is supposed to be set in is broken/missing. Way to go Apple. You're definitely scoring points on this one... negative points.

I took it back to the dealer, they're going to send it back to Apple.

Fuck.
