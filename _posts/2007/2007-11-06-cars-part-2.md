Continuing from [my previous post](https://kcore.org/2007/11/04/cars-cars-cars/), I've now visited a bunch of car manufacturers:  
(all cars are diesel fueled except the hybrid)  

| Brand | Model | Remarks |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| Toyota | Auris Luna Pack<br>(1.4 / 2.0) | + Great outfit for lowish price<br>+ 5 years warranty<br>- Too narrow for two persons<br>- Finishing not really that<br>- 1.4 too weak, 2.0 too expensive |
| Toyota | Prius Sol | + Great outfit<br>+ Ecologically sound<br>+ Geeky<br>- Automatic instead of manual shift<br>- Different way of driving<br>- Expensive </p> |
| Honda | Civic Comfort 2.2 | + Very nice car<br>+ Great interior/exterior design<br>- Too costly in taxes... |
| Honda | Civic Hybrid | + Low emissions<br>- Trunk is too small<br>- Hybrid isn't that useful if you always are in high RPM's |
| Kia | Cee'd EX / Executive<br>1.6 CRDi 115hp |+ 7 years warranty!<br>+ Great outfit for low price<br>- Seats too hard<br>- Cheapish finish |
| Mitsubishi | Colt 1.5 DiD Invite | The car reminds me of my parent's 14-year old Mitsubishi... sturdy, and that's it. Luxury is non-existant. |
| Volkswagen | Golf On-Tour 1.9 105hp| + Sturdy and well finish<br>+ Custom-tailored<br>- Expensive<br>- Only 2 years warranty |

Right now I'm doubting between the Kia and the Volkswagen... If the seats in the Kia hadn't made my back hurt for the remainder of a day (after a 20 min drive) it would win hands-down, but now, it doesn't...
