I've often wondered why people insist on letting their cars run when:

  * they're in a shop, noone in the car
  * waiting in front of a bridge that's up or a train crossing
  * standing still in a huge traffic jam
  * waiting in a closed (underground?) parking lot for someone/something

Don't they get that they're polluting like hell and wasting tons of gas? (And definitely in closed areas, it's very unhealthy) And then people complain about gas prices, about pollution.. but doing \_anything\_ to help a bit? Naaah, too hard.

Meh, humanity. Doomed we are.
