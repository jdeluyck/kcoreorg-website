I finally (well, no, I got the answer from [my thread](http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/showthread.php?p=353661) on [mac-forums.com](http://www.mac-forums.com)) found how to type spanish characters on Mac OS X (thanks to the wonderful [Study Spanish](http://www.studyspanish.com/accents/typing.htm#mac) site):

> To get accents on the Mac, hold down the [Option key](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key), and while holding it down, type the letter e; then release those keys and type the letter that you want the accent to appear on:
> 
> á = Opt + e, then a  
> é = Opt + e, then e  
> í­ = Opt + e, then i  
> ó = Opt + e, then o  
> ú = Opt + e, then u
> 
> For the ñ, hold down the Option key while you type the n; release and type n again.  
> ñ = Opt + n, then n
> 
> To place the diaeresis over the u, hold down the Option key while pressing the u key; release and type u again.  
> ü = Opt + u, then u
> 
> The inverted punctuation marks are achieved as follows:  
> ¡ = Opt + 1  
> ¿ = Opt + shift + ?

Handy, finally I'm able to type those things instead of using the Character Palette / Keyboard Viewer!
