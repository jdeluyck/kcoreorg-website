I finally (well, no, I got the answer from <a HREF="http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/showthread.php?p=353661" TARGET="_blank">my thread</a> on <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.mac-forums.com">mac-forums.com</a>) found how to type spanish characters on Mac OS X (thanks to the wonderful <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.studyspanish.com/accents/typing.htm#mac">Study Spanish</a> site):

> To get accents on the Mac, hold down the <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key">Option key</a>, and while holding it down, type the letter e; then release those keys and type the letter that you want the accent to appear on:
> 
> á = Opt + e, then a  
> é = Opt + e, then e  
> í­ = Opt + e, then i  
> ó = Opt + e, then o  
> ú = Opt + e, then u
> 
> For the ñ, hold down the Option key while you type the n; release and type n again.  
> ñ = Opt + n, then n
> 
> To place the diaeresis over the u, hold down the Option key while pressing the u key; release and type u again.  
> ü = Opt + u, then u
> 
> The inverted punctuation marks are achieved as follows:  
> ¡ = Opt + 1  
> ¿ = Opt + shift + ?

Handy, finally I&#8217;m able to type those things instead of using the Character Palette / Keyboard Viewer!
