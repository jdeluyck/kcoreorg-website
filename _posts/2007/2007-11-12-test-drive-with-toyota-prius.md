Today I managed to get a testdrive with the [Toyota](http://www.toyota.be/) [Prius](http://nl.toyota.be/cars/new_cars/prius/index.aspx) (thanks to [Garage Holvoet](http://netnl.toyota.be/dealers/A5F3CA4D-E065-11D2-9822-006094F96CDD/) in Dendermonde).

Remarks:

  * Very quiet. Amazingly quiet. Sheesh. Too quiet :p
  * Very smooth driving. You don't notice the engine starting or stopping unless you really pay attention
  * Comfy seats
  * Distracting multi-info display. It's too tempting to watch :p
  * The [CVT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission) is nice, but strange (normal since I'm used to driving [stick-shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_shift) cars)
  * Annoying beeping when driving backwards - it's a safety feature, since in this mode it's only running on electric power
  * Slow-ish feeling acceleration - but this could have been me. I'm very careful with other people's cars ;)
  * The absense of engine noise makes you drive too fast very easily - this is something to get used to

Overall, I'm very pleased with the car. It's currently on my nr. 1 spot.
