Today I put them little critters outside for a change, in an old cage we have standing around. It was obvious that they had a bit of a hard time adjusting to all the noises that are there and as such they were hiding a lot...

But - again next weekend! So they can get used to it! :) But I'll get a bigger cage, so they have more space to hop around.
