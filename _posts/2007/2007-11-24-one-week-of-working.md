After one week of working again, here's a quick .. urr.. reviewish kind of thingy:

Trains suck. Really. Comon, it can't be THAT hard to get a train to be on time for atleast the majority of time, not the other way around. I've taken the train 10 times this week, of which it was too late 7 times. Not what I'd call a good track record. (track record.. get it? .. nevermind)

I'm damn tired every evening. Guess I still have to get used to the working cycle again...

It's great to have work! Yay! I have things to do that I find interesting! Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :p
