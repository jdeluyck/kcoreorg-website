It seems that visiting Germany is becoming a habit of ours during summer ;) This time we went to visit Laura, Christian and [Lumi](/assets/images/2007/08/p8191717.jpg) (and [Fina](/assets/images/2007/08/p8191714-me.jpg), the cat) in Germany, last (long) weekend.

Diana and I left for Germany friday 17th, and after a rather boring 2.5 we ended up in [Ratingen](http://www.ratingen.de/). We had a room booked in the [Relexa hotel Ratingen City](http://www.relexa-hotels.de/content/english/viewer/duesseldorf_start_5.html), a nice non-expensive hotel.

(I just want to add here that I absolutely hate their parking entry/exit machines. I got a static zap from them nearly every time! \*growl\*)

After checkin, we went our way to [Frimmersdorf](http://www.frimmersdorf.de/index.htm), in [Grevenbroich](http://www.grevenbroich.de), to visit our friends. It's a lovely town, very very green. Lumi's a very adorable little baby, and the cat is also a fun creature :p Always hunting for flies, to the dismay of Laura and Christian ;)  
We talked a lot, had some takeaway pizza and salad, and left around midnightish.

Next day we met up with [Gundel](http://suse.dentatec.com), a knitty-friend of Diana, in [Düsseldorf](http://www.duesseldorf.de/). We went to a cute yarnshop (called Woll - Duo, in Schamhorstraße 16), where Diana bought some lovely yarn: a skein of [Opal Neon](/assets/images/2007/08/p8201750-me.jpg), two skeins of [OnLine Supersock Silk](/assets/images/2007/08/p8201754-me.jpg), and a ball of [mystery yarn](/assets/images/2007/08/p8201752-me.jpg).  
After that we went for a walk through the city itself, grabbed a quick lunch there (great japanese stall in the basement of a mall), headed back to the hotel, and afterwards went with our friends to the [Lantern Procession](https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/21-lantern_parade_in_wevelinghoven) in [Wevelingenhoven](http://www.wevelinghoven.de/). Very cute, and very strange ;)

On sunday we first (ab)used the wellnesscentre in the hotel (which they were so nice as to open especially for us), and in the afternoon we went to the [AquaZoo](http://www.duesseldorf.de/aquazoo/) in Düsseldorf. Straaaange fish. Straaaaaaaaanger bugs. But educational, and fun too ;)  
There's a lovely park around the aquazoo too, in which we walked for quite a while before heading over to our friends' place, and having some chinese takeaway for dinner.

Monday we had to leave again for Belgium, but we did a short sidestop in [Die Wollfabrik](http://www.die-wollfabrik.de/), where Diana hoarded fiber for spinning and pretty rosewood sock knitting needles.
