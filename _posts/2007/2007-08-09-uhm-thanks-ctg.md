I know some companies are thankful when an employee chooses to work for them (like I did - choosing to go work for CTG)... but it's a first that the employer actually sends flowers to your home address with a thank you note :P

Thanks, CTG ;) You guys (and gals) already scored good points in my book - and I don't even actually \_work\_ there yet!
