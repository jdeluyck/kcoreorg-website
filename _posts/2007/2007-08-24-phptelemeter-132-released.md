I've just released [phptelemeter 1.32](http://phptelemeter.kcore.org/). This version includes the following changes:

  * Added parser simulators for single and separate quotas, for easier development
  * Added option to change your publisher at runtime
  * Added a nice CSS theme to the html publisher (XHTML compliant)
  * Implemented state-tracking for emails (feature request: [1718771](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1718771&group_id=149435&atid=774603))
  * Implemented red-hilighting when you pass a certain percentage (feature request: [1718774](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1718774&group_id=149435&atid=774603))

As per usual, you can download it from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter).
