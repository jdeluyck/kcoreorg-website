_**No christmas stuff before december 15th!**_

The [Radio 1](http://www.radio1.be/) show [Peeters & Pichal](http://www.radio1.be/programmas/pepi/) is [keeping track of early christmas stuff](http://www.radio1.be/programmas/pepi/149432/) appearing. The first things they did was opening a hot-line where people could report early sightings of christmas crap happening.

Now they've started (in cooperation with [Humo](http://www.humo.be/)) a sticker-action: **No christmas stuff before december 15th!**

It's an action I support - It's excessive that stores have already been putting up their christmas stuff since end of september!
