What's with people and their prejudice against the Prius?

People first ask me what car I bought, then usually give me one of the following answers:

  * _Ewwwwww_ (and all it's variations)
  * _Thats a car for old people!_
  * _Such an ugly thing!_
  * _Hybrid? So you have to plug it in at home?_

and countless others.

You also have the other kind of answers:

  * _Cool! Eco!_
  * _Wow, congratz_

but those are still in the minority.

Please, people, get informed before formulating your opinions at me. Thank you, please run along now.
