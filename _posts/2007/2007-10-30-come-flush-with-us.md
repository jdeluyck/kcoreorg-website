**_... or the story of our two-week vacation in Madrid. _**

So, in between the jobs we thought it'd be nice for me (Jan) to go to Madrid for a two-week stay. We looked online, found a nice place with [Rent4Days](http://www.rent4days.com/): a [loft](http://www.rent4days.com/ficha.asp?ciudad=Madrid&idioma=English&mkt=sinmkt&origen=AllApartments&piso=Loft+Ciudad+Lineal+2) located close to [Ciudad Lineal](http://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&hl=es&q=Ciudad+Lineal,+Espa%C3%B1a&sll=40.396764,-3.713379&sspn=12.424862,28.278809&ie=UTF8&oi=georefine&ct=clnk&cd=1&geocode=0,40.437845,-3.638140), some metro stops, in short: nearly ideal. The pics on the site also make you believe it's lovely. It would also be overlooking a park, which is great - nature always is very relaxing. It also says it sleeps 7, so it's gotta be big. Nice!

Diana did some initial shopping the day before, and on the first day we headed over to the place. We were a bit dissapointed, since it was actually more of a store that had been 'reformed' into an appartment. (reformed being a key word here). Oh, and it wasn't really overlooking a park either - you had to get outside, walk a block, and then there's the park. Ah well, as long as it's nice, quiet, cosy...

Boy, were we wrong about this one.

Here's a list of problems with the thing:

Overall problems:

  1. The place is \_cold\_. Both physically cold, and not cosy at all. It lacks furniture, posters, ... anything on the bare walls to make it cosy. We had to put on the heating, while it was 25ºC outside.
  2. _You get to enjoy the sounds of your neighbours peeing, taking a shower,... since every time they flush, or do anything with water, it sounds as if the ceiling is going to collapse. Not fun._
  3. Light. I like light by day. I hate it by night. The curtains (if you can call those pieces of fabric curtains) that were there were utter, total, complete, mega crap. They let through 99,9% of the light.  
    They weren't even long enoug! The bottom part was hung from the curtains using pins... (not even sewn on)
  4. Noise. NOISE. **NOISE!** You hear everything, the smallest movement someone makes in the other appartments, you're part of it, you can follow it, it's all yours!

Bathroom problems:

  1. The bathroom has a leak, from the upstairs neighbours. We reported this, no one came to look or even bothered to call us back.
  2. The [shower](/assets/images/2007/10/pa211879.jpg) is useless - it's got a 5cm deep basin, and the drain is crap, so if you shower, you flood the bathroom.
  3. Again on the shower, don't use it. It will break. We had to buy a new shower tube because it broke, and we didn't want to cough up 50e or more (standard fee by Rent4Days, it costs maybe 8e if you buy it in a shop)

Kitchen problems:

  1. If you dare use the washing machine (good luck without the instructions), and spin stuff, don't be amazed when [the kitchen cabinet falls apart](/assets/images/2007/10/pa211877.jpg).
  2. The sink is placed in a way that you can never stand completely behind it, unless you're a plank. Wonderful.
  3. There are no cabinets. Don't even think of storing anything - there is NO room.
  4. This place is supposed to sleep 7, but forget about eating or drinking with 7. Not enough dishes/glasses/cutlery! You can even forget about cooking for seven! The biggest pot is about 3l.

Bedroom:

  1. This is supposed to be a [double bed](/assets/images/2007/10/pa211878.jpg). It is 120cm wide, the width of a double bed about 30 years ago. Good luck trying to sleep in that with 2 people.

So after about 6 sleepless nights, we moved back into Diana's place (which is tiny and with four definitely over-populated), and called the people of Rent4Days to explain the situation, and to tell them that their offer was below anything possible. What did they tell us? "You are the first persons to complain". On the remark that this place does not overlook a park, they said "We know the area, it overlooks a park." Sorry, it overlooks a GARAGE. Not a park. Not even remotely.

We [took some pics](https://sadevil.org/piwigo/index.php/category/29-madrid_october_2007) so you can compare them with the things on their site.

**So really, if you're looking for something - stay away from Rent4Days. They're crap. Expensive service that offers cheap crap.**

To make a long story short, the rest of the days we spent at Diana's place, and we didn't really do much. The six sleepless nights were enough to drain our energy.

We did [throw a party](/assets/images/2007/10/pa211886-me.jpg) there, for our friends - even though it wasn't allowed. Sorry, but after all this they deserve a very big _screw you_. It was fun, we played Killer Bunnies (having to explain everything to Diana and then she had to translate it into spanish... what a mess \*g\*). We had loads of food, brought by our friends and cooked by us, we also had booze! (sangria and sweet wine), and since it was the last Formula 1 sunday, the tv was on. It was great fun.
