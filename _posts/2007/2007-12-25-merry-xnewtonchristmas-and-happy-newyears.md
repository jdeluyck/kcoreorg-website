Depending on what you (don't) believe, today is [Xmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmas), [Christmas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) or [newtonmas](http://www.paeps.cx/weblog/activism/newtonmas.html). Or even something completely different, if you want it to be!

Whatever is your fancy, happy day to you and a good new year! 

Let's all be (fake) happy and cheery! :p
