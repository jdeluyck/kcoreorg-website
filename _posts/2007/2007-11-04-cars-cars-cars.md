I'm in the market for a car.

Why, you might ask? Because [my future work](/2007/10/30/work-the-neverending-story/) will no longer give me a car to use. That's fine, the payrise covers it (and more ;) )

The questions are:

  * what car?
  * new or second hand?

Half of my friends tell me to buy a new car (even my dad told me to buy a new one - I drive accident free, so why not). The other half of my friends tell me to buy a second-hand one, since a new one is 'throwing away money'. They have a point too.

And what car to buy... I was doubting for a while to go with a [Toyota ](http://www.toyota.be) [Auris](http://nl.toyota.be/cars/new_cars/auris/index.aspx), but the space when sitting with two is too little, it feels very cheaply built and the engine ain't that (the 1.4 diesel, the 2.0 is too expensive). So I scrapped Toyota, and right now the [Volkswagen](http://www.vw.be) [Golf](http://be.volkswagen.com/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/be_nl/models/golf/golf_intro.html) ([On-Tour edition](http://be.volkswagen.com/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/be_nl/models/golf/golf_intro/offres_speciales/Serie_speciale_Escape.html)) with extras. Very nice car, not cheap (unfortunately).

Tomorrow I'll go and have a look at the [Kia](http://www.kia-motors.be) [Cee'd](http://www.kia.com/be/modellen/ceed/) and the [Honda](http://www.honda.be) [Civic Hybrid](http://www.fl.honda.be/content/wagens/modellen_civic_hybrid.html).

So, what do you (dear reader) think?
