Today I went for [another testdrive](/2007/11/12/test-drive-with-toyota-prius/) with the [Toyota](http://www.toyota.be/) [Prius](http://nl.toyota.be/cars/new_cars/prius/index.aspx), longer this time - 2 hours - to see how the car handled in all the usual traffic, and also to be able to judge the seats, the radio, the cruise control, the multi-info-display, everything.

My judgement: it drives great, the seats are very comfy, and it's oh.. so.. quiet ;) The fuel economy for my trip of 130km was 4.7/100km, which isn't bad at all - not having driven a Prius this long before, and not taking special measures to limit gas usage.

So, in the end, I finally comitted, and ordered a [Red](http://nl.toyota.be/cars/new_cars/prius/color.aspx) Toyota Prius!

Now I only have to be patient until somewhere in March 2008 for it to be made and delivered to me.. plenty of time to go look for good insurance ;)
