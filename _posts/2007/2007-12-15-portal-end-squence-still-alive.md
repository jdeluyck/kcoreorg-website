I recently bought [Portal](http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html) - a puzzle game (based on the [Source engine](http://www.valvesoftware.com/sourcelicense/default.htm)) by [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/). The game in itself is fun, but even more fun was the end sequence!

(warning - spoilers ahead - so finish the game first before watching this!)

Read [this wonderful Ars Technica article](http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/10/11/portal-has-the-best-song-in-modern-gaming-here-is-how-you-get-it-from-your-install) if you want to extract it from your Portal installation ;)

You can find the lyrics below:

**Still Alive by [Jonathan Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/)**  
This was a triumph  
I'm making a note here  
HUGE SUCCESS  
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction  
Aperture Science

we do what we must because we can  
for the good of all of us except for the ones who are dead  
but there's no sense crying over every mistake  
you just keep on trying until you run out of cake  
and the science gets done and you make a neat gun  
for the people who are still alive

I'm not even angry  
I'm being so sincere right now  
even though you broke my heart and killed me  
and torn into pieces  
and threw every piece into a fire  
as they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!  
Now these points of data make a wonderful line  
and we're out of beta, we're releasing on time  
so I'm glad I got burned  
Think of all the things we learned for the people that are still alive

go ahead and leave me  
I think I prefer to stay inside  
maybe you'll find someone else to help you  
maybe black mesa  
that was a joke, haha, fat chance  
anyway this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist  
look at me still talking, when there's science to do  
when I look out there it makes me glad I'm not you  
I've experiments to run, there is research to be done  
on the people who are still alive

and believe me I am still alive  
I'm doing science and I'm still alive  
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive  
While you are dying I'll be still alive  
and when you're dead I'll be still alive  
STILL ALIVE, still alive
