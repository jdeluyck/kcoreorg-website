Diana's been here since the 27th of july, and we've been busy bees sofar ! Ofcourse the necessary amount of relaxing and just enjoying the time, too :)

We've replaced one of the closets with a new [Ikea](http://www.ikea.com) [Billy](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/13690607) closet, and are still looking to find a magnetic whiteboard that has been very elusive at best ;) every time the website says they have it, we go and it's no longer there. Pout!

We also went to play catch-up with our movies: we've seen [Pirates Of The Carribean: At World's End](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088/) (good), [Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944836/) (good), [Ratatouille](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/) (hilarious), [Shrek the Third](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413267/) (could have skipped it), [The Simpsons Movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462538/) (good) and [Transformers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/) (good but definitely not for kids).  
(thank you Kinepolis and your cheap 100-days card!)

Diana's cooked loads of lovely meals and also [vegan cupcakes](http://sade.sadevil.org/blog/?p=109) (weird ones ([pic](/assets/images/2007/09/p8021582-me.jpg), [pic](/assets/images/2007/09/p8021585-me.jpg)) but oh so gooooooood)

We also bought three [lovely cacti](/assets/images/2007/09/IMG_3683-me.jpg), which are currently [flowering](/assets/images/2007/09/IMG_3684-me.jpg)!

We've also made [a short trip to Germany](/2007/08/21/short-german-trip/), to visit friends.

Diana had to go back to Spain, unfortunately, though ...
