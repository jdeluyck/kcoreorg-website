I&#8217;ve just released phptelemeter 1.29. This version includes the following changes:

  * Added count of days left until your quota resets.
  * REALLY fix the scarlet_web parser. Thanks Gh0sty!
  * Updated the xmlparser.php external library, the fixes were incorporated upstream.
  * Migrated codebase to svn (from cvs)
  * Increased # of accounts to 99 (request from YvesDM)
  * Fixed dommel_web parser to work with new counter
  * Reformatted documentation to fit on 80-char wide terminals

As per usual, you can download it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptelemeter" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.
