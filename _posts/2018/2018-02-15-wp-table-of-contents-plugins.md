I was using the rather nice [Table Of Contents+](https://wordpress.org/plugins/table-of-contents-plus/) WordPress plugin to auto-generate tables of content on certain posts/pages, but that has since been abandoned. Luckely [Steven A. Zahm](http://connections-pro.com/) took over development, and presto, we have the [Easy Table of Contents](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-table-of-contents/) plugin. You can peruse the [sourcecode](https://github.com/shazahm1/Easy-Table-of-Contents) on GitHub.
