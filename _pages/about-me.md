My name is Jan De Luyck, currently inhabiting a small town near [Lochristi](http://www.lochristi.be/). 
I'm happily living together with my partner, Diana.

I've studied [Applied Computer Sciences](https://www.hogent.be/toekomstige-student/opleidingen/bachelors/toegepaste-informatica/) at the [Hogeschool Gent](https://www.hogent.be), and as such, I'm pretty much a technical-minded person.
I'm mostly busy dealing with technology - be it at home, on Linux, Android, cloud, related to some hardware projects, software, or at work.

In 2001, after graduating, I went to work for Tri-enniuM (now known as [Rivium](http://rivium.nl/nl)), as a consultant for Reuters real-time trading environments. 
I've since moved on, and now work for [KBC](https://www.kbc.com/en), as a systems engineer - where I've been busy with the architecture of our Linux / Unix platforms and providing 3<sup>rd</sup> level support for our in-house customers, and currently working on building our cloud portfolio.

In my spare time I'm also a singer (tenor) at [Kamerkoor Furiant](https://artemusicale.be/ensembles/kamerkoor-furiant/) in Ghent, a bagpipe player at the [Flemish Caledonian Pipes & Drums "Clan MacKenzie"](http://www.fcpd.be/), an avid pen-and-paper role-player and a fan of boardgames :)
